# src/ Directory

This directory is intended for core, reusable Python modules and packages that are shared across the project. Place new core logic and refactored modules here to improve modularity and maintainability.

## Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive names for submodules.
- Add a README.md to each submodule explaining its purpose and usage.
- Avoid placing environment-specific or one-off scripts here.
